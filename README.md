Reads an xmg image to display it to the terminal (i need to get the value of stty size with a pipe to scale with the terminal size but i'm too tired)

./ascxpm "file.xpm" 

dezoom in termnal to see (and idk why the pictures displays themselves weirdly rn but no leaks (dont try with anything else than xpm))

cool results with: 
  full dezoom ->  ./asxpm "file.xpm" | bat
